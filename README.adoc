**The definitive Idris 2 static site generator.**

== Overview

ddraig-ssg (Welsh for "dragon") is a dependently-typed static site generator
written in Idris 2. It uses dependent types to provide compile-time correctness
guarantees that are impossible in other languages.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in Idris 2. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Haskell (even though related)
* Any language other than Idris 2

The **ONLY** non-Idris code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== Features

* Dependent types for provably correct site generation
* Totality checking ensures all code paths are handled
* Compile-time validation of content structure
* First-class support for typed templates
* Interactive theorem proving for complex constraints

== Requirements

* Idris 2
